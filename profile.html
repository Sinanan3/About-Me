			A little about me
			</h2>
		</li>
			<p><font color="black">Hi I'm Mikhail, 27 years old and although I moved around a fair amount as a child, I grew up mostly in Mount Vernon, NY. I graduated from Nelson Mandela High school and immediately got into the work force after high school, landing my first job doing sales/stock at <a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/" target="_blank">Nordstrom</a>. 

			<br> I went on to work a bunch of jobs mostly in retail, in between all this I got my girlfriend at the time pregnant and my son Samuel was born in 2012! I eventually got a job as a perioperative patient assistant at New York Presbyterian Cornell Medical center.
			
			<br>
			That job felt fulfilling but I've always had a feeling to go more of the entreprenurial/ creative route, so I left and became a full-time Airbnb Host. That was great until the owners of the home I was renting decided they were selling the house so I had to leave the space.
			</p>
			<p>All this unstability made me very uncomfortable and I thought to myself "its time to grow up, stick to something and get great at it so I can provide a much better life for myself as well as my little boy. I thought of my friend Mike who told me about a boot camp for coding he went to, I'd saw an instagram sponsored ad for FlatIron school and jumped on it immediately. I applied and went throught the whole process of pre requisites and got accepted but could not afford it and couldnt secure a loan due to my credit history(childish mistakes caught up). This really put me down but I decided I am determined to push through the adversity. I also made a friend, John, who's been a senior software developer at Chegg for a year now, hes helped me some and motivated me in my new endeavor. 

			I've realized that learning to be a software dev takes hours and hours of study and discipline to really retain knowledge.
